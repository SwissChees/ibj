        <h2>August 6 - Campaign Monitor Youth Fundraiser Email</h2>
        <h3>Email versions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/v1-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Version 1</a>:
            This does not work for many Outlook applications because Outlook frickin' sucks.<br>
            I used divs, but Outlook disregards margin and padding for div elements.</li>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/v2-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Version 2</a>:
            This was my version of the flyer. I converted all the divs into tables (using Gemini).<br>
            Then I added some more details.
            </li>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/final-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Final</a>:
            The one that we sent out on Campaign Monitor to nearly 18,000 people.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stuff I learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Outlook is the worst.</li>
            <li>Gmail and Outlook don't support negative margins.</li>
            <li>Getting people to read your campaign emails is difficult.
                <ul>
                    <li>17,150 emails sent.</li>
                    <li>Only 573, or 3%, of recipients clicked on a link.</li>
                    <li>Of those 573 only 2 people, or 0.3%, donated.*<br>
                    <span class="small">* These numbers are as of August 8, 2025.</span></li>
                </ul>
            <li>See support for HTML/CSS elements by email platform <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
