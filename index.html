        <ul>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/v1-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Version 1</a>:
            This does not work for many Outlook applications because Outlook frickin' sucks.<br>
            I used divs, but Outlook disregards margin and padding for div elements.</li>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/v2-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Version 2</a>:
            This was my version of the flyer. I converted all the divs into tables (using Gemini).<br>
            Then I added some more details.
            </li>
            <li><a href="youth-fundraiser-email/final-youth-fundraiser-email.html">Final</a>:
            The one that we sent out on Campaign Monitor to nearly 18,000 people.
