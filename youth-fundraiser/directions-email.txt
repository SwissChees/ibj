Dear friend, 

Thank you for kindly RSVPing to our Youth Justice Fundraiser. 

Enclosed in this email are further instructions on maps and parking for the August 12th event.

Voir les directions en fran√ßais ici.

There are two entrances to Florimont. The entrance along Chemin du Bac has more parking space, so please try to enter at that gate. 
The entrance at Av. du Petit-Lancy also has a couple parking spots, so please do not be discouraged if the GPS directs you there. 

After parking, there will be signs pointing you in the right direction. 


With love,
IBJ Youth Team
